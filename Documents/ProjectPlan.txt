Epics:
* As a Business Analyist I need to gather requirements so that the developers will know what the system needs to do.
- As a Designer I need to create a wireframe so that the Business can see how the system will behave
- As a Developer I need to manage tasks so that I know what needs to be done for the system

Stories:
- As a Business Analyst I need to enter gathered requirements in the system so that I can keep track of them
-- needs Title
-- needs Assigned To
-- needs State - Gathering, Approved, Ready for Design/Development, Developed
-- needs Requirements
-- Definition Of Done
- As a Business Analyst I need the ability to search requirements so that I can find previously entered ones


Engineering Tasks:
- Create out project
- get testing working
- automated build
- get continous builds going


Questions:
What are requirements - define the needs of the stakeholders
- who are the stakeholders?
-- I'm the stake holder
--- my needs
---- I need requirements clear and concise
---- I need flexibility in the way my requirements are defined
---- I need to be able to link the requirements to the items that fulfill the requirements

- Formats - should be non specific, easily adaptable to current needs
- length - I would prefer smaller but need to be able to support lengths up to 5000 characters
- How do we know we got it right? - someplace where we can set the definition of done.


Brainstorming:
- Requirements Item type ?
- Query requirements?
- Requirements to link to other items.
